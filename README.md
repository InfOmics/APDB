##  APDB: a database on air pollutants characterization and similarity prediction

**APDB** is a publicly available online database which improves our knowledge of the existing pollutant molecules, providing an in-depth insight into their physicochemical, structural and quantum properties. The collection of pollutant molecular structures together with all the chemical characteristics and 
descriptors provided in **APDB**, offers scientists a unique resource for a wide view of the biochemical aspects of pollutant toxicity mechanisms.

**APDB** is available at: http://apdb.di.univr.it
